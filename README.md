# Source Code for Lucene In Action ![Build Status](https://github.com/shaikhu/lucene_in_action/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Lucene in Action is an excellent book available [here](https://www.manning.com/books/lucene-in-action-second-edition)... however the code examples are outdated.

This is an attempt to update the code examples (where possible) using Apache Lucene [9.11.1](https://lucene.apache.org/core/9_11_1/).

## Versions

- Lucene: 9.11.1
- Tika 2.8.0
- Gradle 8.5
- JDK 17
